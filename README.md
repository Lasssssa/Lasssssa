# My profile

👋 Hi, I’m @Lasssssa, I'm an IT Engineering student in computer science at INSA Lyon. 

💻📱Passionate about computer science for a long time, I chose to integrate an engineering school offering a course in this field in order to be able to directly practice many languages useful in companies. 

🎯 Conceptualize and develop new technological solutions for companies, is what characterizes the job of software engineer as I see it. I'm always ready to take on new challenges !

➡️ Choosing me, as a future collaborator, is also choosing someone who is dynamic, determined, curious and who loves to work in a team.
