- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lasssssa, I'm an IT Engineering student in computer science. 
- 
- 💻📱Passionate about computer science for a long time, I chose to integrate an engineering school offering a course in this field in order to be able to directly practice many languages useful in companies. 

🎓 Currently a second year student of "IT & Networks", I wish to ensure missions in the Software Engineering sector.

🎯 Conceptualize and develop new technological solutions for companies, is what characterizes the job of software engineer as I see it. I'm always ready to take on new challenges !

➡️ Choosing me, as a future collaborator, is also choosing someone who is dynamic, determined, curious and who loves to work in a team.
